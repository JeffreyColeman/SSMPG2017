The results of OutFLANK for the cichlid data are posted here:

Note that the large amount of LD among SNPs in this dataset causes deviations from the chi-squared distribution. 

With LD pruning, the chi-squared distribution fits the Fst distribution well, but some of the signal is lost through the process of pruning.
