The pseudo-observed data in the file 'cichlid-filtmaf1p/calibration/pod_cichlid-filtmaf1p.selestim' were simulated using the posterior means of the model parameters, from the analysis of the following dataset:

A total of 6000 loci were simulated. To that end, the posterior means of the pi parameters were sampled with replacement from the 30817 loci of the original data.
